# About `barf`

barf is a minimal and suckless-inspired blog generator. It is a tweaked and slightly patched version of Karl Bartel's fantastic [blog.sh](https://github.com/karlb/karl.berlin).

## Why?

This project was created by me, [Bradley Taunt](https://btxx.org), out of frustration with overly complex and bloated blogging options. I tried *so many* "minimal" generators but each one ended up having some glaring issue or heavy reliance on dependencies. 

I wanted to have a system that I could easily replicate on any Linux machine. Something that didn't require me to download half the internet just to get up and running. I'm a sucker for keeping things simple.
